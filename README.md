2.ros3: Write ROS (topic, service) communication programming

3.ros4: ROS commonly used tool components package, the preparation of launch files

4.ros5: URDF Robot modeling

5.ros6: Robot simulation (create simulation environment, controller plug-in, sensor simulation)

6.ros7: ROS camera driver and data interface, parameter calibration

7.ros9: cartograph mapping test
